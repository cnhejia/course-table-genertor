# The Rules to set course in a smart way: 

For the course that needs to be treated specially:
 - sort the courses and put the special course at the front positions
  
When setting course A, try to consider to:
 - [ ] add virtual course if the time before or after A concatenats with A
 - [ ] not put the course in a period that does not have break in it
